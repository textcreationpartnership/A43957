         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That after this he underſtood by Captain <hi>VValcot,</hi> that Mr. <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> manages the Aſſaſſinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Inſurrection.</note> 
               <hi>Ferguſon</hi> had the <hi>management</hi> of the <hi>Aſſaſſination</hi> in <hi>October,</hi> and that he was likewiſe acquainted with the <hi>Inſurrection,</hi> and was a great Man in it. That among many ways propoſed of <hi>killing</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Duke,</hi> Captain <hi>VValcot</hi> told him, That one was Deſign'd at the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi>'s <hi>Feaſt</hi> in the <hi>Hall,</hi> or upon their return home in <hi>Pauls Church-Yard,</hi> or at <hi>Ludgate,</hi> but that the <hi>King</hi> not Dining there, the thing was wholly diſappointed, and that Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> told him the ſame thing. Then Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon</hi> propos'd another way, That it ſhould be done, as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> went down the <hi>River,</hi> by <hi>Perſons</hi> that were to lye behind ſome ſmall <hi>Ships</hi> in a <hi>Hoy,</hi> and ſo over-run their <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> or if that fail'd, to break a <hi>Plank</hi> with their <hi>Blunderbuſſes,</hi> and ſo ſink them. Another way was, At the <hi>Play-Houſe,</hi> where <hi>Forty</hi> or <hi>Fifty Men</hi> were to get into the <hi>Pitt,</hi> which had <hi>Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes, Piſtols,</hi> and <hi>Swords,</hi> and when the <hi>Muſick</hi> ſtruck up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Acts,</hi> ſhould <hi>Fire</hi> upon the <hi>Box.</hi> But that this way ſeeming <hi>Hazardous,</hi> they thought it better to do it as he came back, and pitch'd upon <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> under <hi>Bedford-VVall,</hi> in regard there was a <hi>Conveniency</hi> for a great many Men to Walk in the <hi>Piazza,</hi> and another parcel of Men might be planted in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden-Church-Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then it was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how they ſhould put the <hi>Deſign</hi> in <hi>Execution,</hi> upon which it was propoſed, That <hi>one</hi> party was to fall upon the <hi>Coach-Horſes,</hi> a <hi>ſecond</hi> upon the <hi>Coach,</hi> and a <hi>third</hi> upon the <hi>Guards,</hi> and that for Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> he would undertake nothing but the <hi>Guards.</hi>

            <p>Here Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> interrupted the <hi>Witneſs</hi> with an <hi>Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> calling out, <hi>what do you ſay</hi> Sir? to which the <hi>Kings Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> made anſwer with an <hi>Affirmative,</hi> that the <hi>Priſoner</hi> at the Bar was at his <hi>Chamber,</hi> and ſaid that he vvas to command the Party of <hi>Horſe</hi> that vvere to attack the <hi>Guards,</hi> vvho vvere to lye <hi>perdue</hi> at <hi>Rumbolds</hi> Houſe, till the <hi>King</hi> juſt came dovvn upon them.</p>

That being thus retired, they got Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> into the <hi>City,</hi> that <hi>Rumbold</hi> Diſcours'd him in the preſence of ſeveral <hi>Perſons;</hi> but that Mr. <hi>Keeling</hi> wiſhed a great many <hi>Imprecations</hi> upon himſelf, if he had Diſcover'd. That then, after ſome <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> him, they propos'd to him to go out of <hi>Town</hi> which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. That the ſame Night they trac'd him from place to place, and finding that he was gone to the <hi>Secretaries Lodgings,</hi> they took it for granted that the <hi>Diſcovery</hi> was made, and that every Man muſt ſhift for himſelf. That upon that, Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> ſaid, That if the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would go into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> they might try a puſh for it ſtill, and that the <hi>Priſoner</hi> at the <hi>Bar</hi> ſaid, That he was ſatisfi'd God would deliver the <hi>Nation,</hi> but that he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Walcot</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, that God did not like the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but would deliver the Nation.</note> did not approve of the preſent <hi>Instruments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the ſum of what was faſtned upon the <hi>Priſoner</hi> was, That he was at ſeveral <hi>Conſults</hi> about <hi>Killing</hi> or <hi>Securing</hi> the <hi>King.</hi> That he went down to <hi>Rumbold</hi>'s <hi>Houſe,</hi> to view the place where it might be done with moſt ſafety, and that he undertook to <hi>Fight</hi> the <hi>Guards,</hi> if he might have a conſiderable number of Men.</p>
            <p>To this Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> Pleaded, That he never was at <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold</hi>'s <hi>Houſe,</hi> but once as he <hi>Travell'd</hi> from <hi>York</hi> by <hi>Norwich,</hi> and ſo to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which Colonel <hi>Rumſey</hi> Reply'd, That the <hi>Priſoner</hi> did buy a <hi>Horſe,</hi> and ſaid he intended to go down, and to the beſt of his <hi>Remembrance,</hi> ſaid, He was down. But that he bought a <hi>Horſe</hi> which coſt him 20 <hi>l.</hi> for that purpoſe he was certain.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſtill denying the <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> and Pleading that he lay <hi>Sick</hi> of the <hi>Gout,</hi> all the while the <hi>King</hi> was at <hi>New-Market,</hi> a <hi>Letter</hi> was produc'd under his own hand to Sir <hi>Lionel Jenkins, Secretary of State,</hi> purporting, <note place="margin">A Letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand to Sir <hi>Lionel Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <q>That being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſee himſelf in His <hi>Majeſties Proclamation,</hi> he reſolv'd to lay himſelf at His <hi>Majesties Feet,</hi> let him do with him what he pleas'd; and acknowledging his <hi>Crime,</hi> which he ſays was the firſt that he had Committed ſince his <hi>Majeſties Reſtauration,</hi> he purpoſed to Diſcover to him all that he knew Relating to <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he ſuppoſed might be more then the <hi>Original Diſcoverer</hi> was able to acquaint His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> with; And farther, That if His <hi>Majeſty</hi> thought fit, he would follow thoſe <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who were fled, and as ſoon as he could, would inform His <hi>Majeſty</hi> what meaſures they intended to take next.

               <hi>Sunday Night</hi> Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> ſent for him, and ſeemed very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to wait upon His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and to unboſom himſelf to the <hi>King.</hi> That <hi>Yeſterday Morning</hi> his Son coming to him, he ſent his <hi>Clark</hi> along with him to his <hi>Father,</hi> who Diſcovered a little <hi>Paper</hi> in his <hi>Hand,</hi> which he had intended to have given to his Son, which afterwards the <hi>Priſoner</hi> deſired him to make no uſe of ſince he had Diſcovered it. The <hi>Letter</hi> was to Captain <hi>Tracy</hi> his <hi>Landlord,</hi> to ſpeak to Colonel <hi>Rumſey,</hi> to be tender of him, and to tell him he had <hi>Ground</hi> enough to ſerve the <hi>King</hi> upon other Men, and to ſpeak to Mrs. <hi>Weſt,</hi> to deſire the ſame thing of her <hi>Husband;</hi> and that the laſt words of the <hi>Note</hi> were, <hi>If you cannot be private, leavè the Iſſue to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the whole the <hi>Priſoner</hi> Pleaded, That the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> had <note place="margin">The Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pleads his being out of <hi>England.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That as to his undertaking to Charge the <hi>Guards</hi> when he came into <hi>England,</hi> it was an improbable thing, for that he knew there was no difference between <hi>Killing</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>ſecuring</hi> the <hi>Guards.</hi> But it was plain, That the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> had ſufficiently dipp'd themſelves, and therefore to ſave their own Lives, they had combin'd to take away his.</p>

            <p>Being ask'd why he frequented the Company where he heard thoſe things? He Anſwered, It was his <hi>Folly,</hi> and conceiv'd it was only <hi>Miſpriſion of Treaſon:</hi> For it was true, he had heard a great deal of what the <hi>VVitneſſes</hi> had ſaid touching an <hi>Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but that he had no hand directly or indirectly in it, nor did the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> ever enter into his thoughts directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly; And that when ſome <hi>Gentlemen</hi> talk'd to him of it, he abominated it as a <hi>Scandalous Thing,</hi> a reproach to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion,</hi> and that his <hi>Children</hi> would bear the reproach of it. But the <hi>Court</hi> told him he fail'd in his <hi>Law,</hi> for though to hear of <hi>Treaſon</hi> accidentally or occaſionally and conceal it was but <hi>Miſpriſion,</hi> yet if a Man would be at a <hi>Conſult</hi> where <hi>Treaſon</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106408:12"/> was Hatch'd, and then conceal'd it, he was then Guilty of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jury</hi> then deſiring he might be ask'd what he had to ſay <note place="margin">He alledges his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in his Letter, to be upon his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with Mr. <hi>Ferguſon.</hi>
               </note> to the <hi>Letter?</hi> the <hi>Priſoner</hi> made Anſwer, That what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he undertook upon his <hi>Intimacy</hi> with Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> by whoſe means he believ'd he ſhould have an <hi>Intereſt</hi> with the reſt. That he did according to his promiſe, give an <hi>Accompt</hi> of what he had heard, but that the <hi>King</hi> was not pleas'd with him, becauſe he did not deſcend to particulars, which he could not do, in regard he had never been in their <hi>Company,</hi> nor knew any thing but what he had by a <hi>private hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his <hi>Confeſſion</hi> that <hi>it was his firſt Crime,</hi> it was only as far as <hi>Miſpriſſion</hi> went, having never acted or intended the <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt place he produc'd one <hi>VVitneſs</hi> to prove when he <note place="margin">He produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a Witneſs about his <hi>Gout.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Attorney General</hi> inſiſting to have as much read as was neceſſary to prove the <hi>Indictment,</hi> the <hi>Priſoner</hi> deſired it might be all read.

It were a moſt abſur'd folly to ſay, That a Man might not put away, or in ſome places, Kill an Adulterous Wife, a Diſobedient Son, or an unlawful Servant, becauſe he is Party and Judge.

            <p>
               <hi>For this Reaſon</hi> Bracton <hi>ſays that the King has three Superiours,</hi> Deum, Legem, &amp; Parliamentum: <hi>that is, The Power Originally in the People of</hi> England <hi>is delegated to the Parliament. He is ſubject to the Law of God as a Man, to the People that makes him King, in as much as he is a King. The Law ſets a meaſure to that ſubjection, and the Parliament Judges of the particular Caſes thereupon ariſing. He must be content to ſubmit his Intereſt to theirs, ſince he is no more then any of them in any other reſpect then that he is by the common Conſent of all rais'd above any other.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>After this the <hi>Attorney General</hi> ſaid, He had only one piece of <hi>Evidence</hi> to give more: That he was one of the <hi>Accomplices</hi> of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and therefore he would give in <hi>Evidence</hi> his <hi>Conviction.</hi> To which purpoſe the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was ask'd, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was not Sworn as a <hi>Witneſs</hi> at the <hi>Tryal</hi> of the Lord <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel?</hi> who Anſering, <hi>Yes;</hi> The next <hi>Queſtion</hi> was, Whether in thoſe debates, there were any <hi>Reflections</hi> upon the <hi>King</hi> that he <note place="margin">Reflections upon the Kings Miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, particularly for impoſing upon the City</note> had broken his <hi>Duty?</hi> to which the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Anſwered, Not perſonally upon the <hi>King,</hi> but upon his <hi>Miſgovernment,</hi> and principally that which they thought was the general diſguſt of the <hi>Nation,</hi> their impoſing upon the <hi>City</hi> at that time: which was the thing then complain'd of, and look'd upon as the chief <hi>Grievance.</hi>

            <p>Now that ſuch Men as thoſe were, hardly knowing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould preſently fall into a great and intimate Friendſhip, and truſt and management of ſuch buſineſſes as thoſe were, was a

That it was certainly a <hi>Sham,</hi> even to his knowledge, too black for any <hi>Miniſter</hi> of publick Employment to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd, but that it was forg'd by <hi>People</hi> in the <hi>Dark,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that it was in his <hi>Conſcience.</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he adviz'd him to make an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> under his hand to teſtify his abhorrency of the <hi>Thing.</hi> Then being ask'd by his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> to whom he ſhould apply himſelf, he pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> and going to him, told him, that the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was willing to ſet it under his hand, his deteſtation of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and that there was no ſuch thing to his knowledge: but that upon the Lord <hi>Ruſſels</hi> being taken, the thing was laid aſide.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> declar'd, That about ſix Weeks ſince, the Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Grace Tracey</hi> declar'd, That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> proteſted he <note place="margin">Of <hi>Grace Tracy.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth Penwick</hi> declared, That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> ask'd for <note place="margin">Of <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Penwick.</hi>
               </note> him? and they ſaid he was taken away by a Man to the <hi>Tower</hi> for a <hi>Plot;</hi> upon which he took <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Witneſs,</hi> that he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, neither did the Colonel; but ſaid it was only <hi>Malice,</hi> deſiring withal that the Colonels <hi>Plate</hi> might be ſent to his Houſe to be ſecur'd.</p>
            <p>Then one Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> ſtood up, and offer'd to the <hi>Court,</hi> that <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> offers to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the hand.</note> if the ſheets might be ſhewn him, he would undertake to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them in a little time, that they ſhould not know which was which.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Priſoner</hi> proceeding to his <hi>Defence,</hi> ſet forth, That <note place="margin">The Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner proceeds in his defence. He argues upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi>
               </note> there was a large <hi>Complication</hi> of <hi>Crimes</hi> laid to his <hi>Charge.</hi> That he underſtood they were under the <hi>Statute</hi> of the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> That the <hi>Statute</hi> had two Branches, one relating to <hi>War,</hi> the other to the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi> That that which related to the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> made the Conſpiring, Imagining, and Compaſſing the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> to be Criminal. That the Branch concerning <hi>War</hi> was not ſo, unleſs it were levy'd. That he could not imagin to which of the two they referr'd his <hi>Crime;</hi> For that to ſay that a Man did meet to Conſpire the <hi>Kings Death,</hi> and for him that gave the <hi>Accompt</hi> of the buſineſs not to ſay one word of it ſeem'd extravagant.</p>
            <p>For that <hi>Conſpiracies</hi> had always their <hi>Denomination</hi> from that Point to which they tended. That the King had two <hi>Capacities Natural</hi> and <hi>Politick:</hi> that the <hi>Politick</hi> could not be within the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> for in that ſenſe he never dy'd; ſo it was abſur'd, to ſay it ſhould be a fault to Kill the <hi>King</hi> who never dy'd. That then it muſt be underſtood in the <hi>Natural Senſe,</hi> which was to be done either by <hi>Sword, Piſtol,</hi> or other violent way. So that if there were not one word of this, then it was utterly at an end, though the <hi>Witneſs</hi> had been good.</p>
            <p>That as to the Point of Levying <hi>War</hi> it was made <hi>Treaſon,</hi> ſo it <note place="margin">He argues as to the Point of Levying War.</note> were prov'd by an <hi>Overt Act,</hi> but that there never was an <hi>Overt Act,</hi> or could be pretended in his <hi>Caſe.</hi> So that if the <hi>War</hi> were not Levy'd, it was not within the <hi>Act.</hi> Therefore in his <hi>Caſe</hi> it was imply'd, it was firſt imagin'd, that he intended to raiſe a <hi>War,</hi> and then it was imagin'd that that <hi>War</hi> ſhould tend to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> which though it might follow, was neither <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> and ſo could not be ſo underſtood by the <hi>Law.</hi> That therefore it was two diſtinct things to make <hi>War,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:106408:31"/> to make <hi>War:</hi> beſides that, the <hi>Law required two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That as to the buſineſs of <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> told <note place="margin">The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturally and implecitely Sworn.</note> it ſo imperfectly, and ſo meerly conjecturally, that there was nothing in it but his <hi>Rhetoric</hi> to ſet it out; for that he never told by whom it was Writ, nor what was in it, or whether it were delivered or no. And whereas it was urg'd that the <hi>Scotch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> came to <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then he ask'd what <hi>Concat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Witneſs,</hi> were he Credible, he ſaid, but a few Men talking at large what might, or what might not be; what was like to fall out without any manner of <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or doing any thing. That they did not ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether there were Men, Arms, or Ammunition. That it was a <hi>War</hi> to be made by five or ſix Men not knowing one another, nor truſting one another: for which he inſtanc'd Dr. <hi>Cox', Evidence</hi> at the Lord <hi>Ruſſels Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Something more he ſaid to the ſame purpoſe, but concluded as to this Point, that the <hi>Court</hi> was not to make any <hi>Conſtructive Treaſons,</hi> but to go according to plain proof; <hi>Conſtructive Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> belonging only to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as by the immediate <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> in the <hi>Act,</hi> and by ſeveral other <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> appear'd. And therefore he thought it impoſſible for the <hi>Jury</hi> to find the <hi>Matter:</hi> for that the firſt Point was only prov'd by the Lord <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> who as he thought was no Body, and the laſt concerning the <hi>Papers,</hi> was only imaginary, from the ſimilitude of Hands.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Priſoner</hi> having thus made his <hi>Defence,</hi> the <hi>Solicitor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> ſumm'd up the <hi>Evidence,</hi> and anſwered all the <hi>Priſoners Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> with that Learning and Eloquence, that nothing could be more convincing.</p>
            <p>When he had done, the <hi>Priſoner</hi> offer'd again to have ſpoken to the <hi>Court;</hi> but it was told him, that after the <hi>Kings Council</hi> had concluded, the <hi>Priſoner</hi> was never admitted to ſay any thing more. And then the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> told the <hi>Jury</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, That what the <hi>Priſoner</hi> had ſaid, that was not prov'd; and what the <hi>Kings Council</hi> had ſaid, of which there was no proof to make it out, was not to be taken into any Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Solicitor General</hi> deſir'd one word more as well for <note place="margin">The Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Generals requeſt to the Court, in his own and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners behalf.</note> his own as the <hi>Priſoners</hi> Sake; That if he had ſaid any thing

            </p>
            <p>This done, the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> deliver'd his <hi>Charge</hi> to the <note place="margin">The Lord Chief Juſtice delivers his Charge to the Jury.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Monday, November</hi> the <hi>26th.</hi> Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> was again <note place="margin">He is brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> brought up to the <hi>Bar</hi> of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> to receive his <hi>Sentence,</hi> and being ask'd the uſual <hi>Question?</hi> He Pleaded firſt,</p>
            <p>That he conceiv'd he had had no <hi>Tryal,</hi> for that he was to be <hi>Tryed</hi> by his <hi>Country,</hi> but he did not find his <hi>Country</hi> in the <hi>Jury</hi> that <hi>Try'd</hi> him, in regard there were ſome of them that were not <hi>Freeholders;</hi> and therefore if he had had no <hi>Tryal,</hi> there could be no <hi>Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the <hi>Court</hi> reply'd, That it had been the <hi>Opinion</hi> of all the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Caſe</hi> laſt proceeding his, that by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> the <hi>Tryal</hi> of <hi>Treaſon</hi> was put as it was at <hi>Common Law,</hi> and that there was no ſuch <hi>Challenge</hi> at <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then deſir'd a <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> to argue it; but it was told him, It was not in the Power of the <hi>Court</hi> to do it.</p>
            <p>He then deſir'd the <hi>Indictment</hi> might be read again, which being done, he urg'd that it was void, becauſe it depriv'd the <hi>King</hi> of his <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Defenſor Fidei,</hi> which was <hi>Treaſon</hi> by the <hi>Law.</hi> But the <hi>Court</hi> did not think it a material Objection.</p>
            <p>He urg'd there was no <hi>Treaſon</hi> in the <hi>Papers,</hi> and nothing prov'd of them: to which it was anſwered, That there was not a Line but what was <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he deſired that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> might be ſent for, and offer'd to acknowledge what ever they pleas'd, if he would ſay there was any ſuch thing as a <hi>Deſign,</hi> or knew any thing of it.</p>
            <p>But it was told him that was over, ſince he had been Try'd for the <hi>Fact.</hi> Upon which he put forth theſe words, <hi>If you will</hi> 
               <note place="margin">He gives Offence to the Court.</note> 
               <hi>call it a Tryal;</hi> which was ill-reſented by the <hi>Court,</hi> as if he went about to Arraign the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he complain'd that the <hi>Jury</hi> were not ſummon'd by the <hi>Baliff,</hi> but were agreed upon by the under <hi>Sheriff</hi> and others, and ask'd whether that were a good <hi>Jury?</hi> to which the <hi>Court</hi> made Anſwer, That they could take notice of nothing but what was upon the <hi>Record,</hi> and it appear'd that the <hi>Sheriff</hi> had made his return.</p>
            <p>What he alleadg'd more, was nothing but what he had urg'd <note place="margin">The Court pronounces Judgment.</note> in his <hi>Defence</hi> upon the Point of <hi>Conſtructive Treaſon;</hi> So that the <hi>Court</hi> proceeded to Judgment, which was given accordingly.

The ſecond Swore, That Sir <hi>Hugh Cambel,</hi> Sir <hi>George Cambel, Bayley,</hi> and ſome others were taken in <hi>Black-Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> and that he took the reſt in a cunning Hole in <hi>Moor-Fields,</hi> who were afterwards ſent <hi>Priſoners</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the ſum of the <hi>Evidence</hi> againſt the <hi>Priſoner</hi> was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation in Order to the raiſing of Men to infeſt the Government. <note place="margin">The ſum of the Evidence.</note> A <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> concerning the raiſing of Money and Arms for that end: the places where, and the time when: and the Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a friendſhip with ſome diſcontented <hi>Perſons</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Priſoner</hi> by his <hi>Council</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> anſwers for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</note> That whereas the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was poſitive and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as to ſome things in reference to Perſons, Places, and Times, yet in what moſt effected the <hi>Defendant,</hi> he was not any thing like poſitive as to the times of. the <hi>Meeting,</hi> but only that it was about the middle of <hi>January,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>February.</hi> And thereupon he made this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> That ſince the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> would not be particular as to the Time, it might be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that he gave himſelf a little looſe, that he might not be contradicted in that <hi>Circumſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Witneſs</hi> were particular as to many <hi>Facts</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> relating to the Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> where he Names other particular Perſons and Diſcourſes, yet he had not made uſe of any one <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> in the <hi>Caſe</hi> of the <hi>Defendant,</hi> ſave only that of <hi>Aaron Smith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place it was urg'd, That in regard there were other <hi>Witneſſes</hi> before, and beſide the <hi>Evidence,</hi> to the <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of the <hi>Plot,</hi> it concern'd the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to give a home <hi>Evidence</hi> in the <hi>Caſe,</hi> or elſe he could have no expectation of his <hi>Pardon;</hi> and that therefore he was concerned perhaps to ſtrain, that he might make ſuch a <hi>Diſcovery</hi> as might anſwer his end; which the <hi>Counſel</hi> ſuppoſed would Naturally ariſe out of this <hi>Caſe,</hi> ſince it was ſomething long before he got his <hi>Pardon,</hi> but that now he had it.</p>
            <p>After this, ſeveral <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> were produced, to prove the Lord <hi>Howards</hi> denyal of a <hi>Plot,</hi> that he knew of none, and believ'd the whole thing a <hi>Contrivance.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Daughter, young Mrs. <hi>Edwards,</hi> affirm'd the ſame thing, That the Boy did tell them ſuch a <hi>Story</hi> at firſt, but that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Mrs. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> the Daughter.</note> he affirm'd it was all a <hi>Story,</hi> and meerly his own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being ask'd by <hi>Braddon,</hi> whether ſhe did not frighten him, by threatening his <hi>Father</hi> would be turn'd out of his place? ſhe Anſwered, <hi>No;</hi> being upon her <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jane Loadman</hi> being Sworn, depoſed, That ſhe ſaw a hand throw a <hi>Razor</hi> out of a <hi>Window,</hi> but ſhe could not tell what <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>

            <p>Being ask'd whether the <hi>Razor</hi> were thrown on the in-ſide of the <hi>Pales,</hi> or the out-ſide? ſhe Anſwered, The out-ſide, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Boy who had ſaid the in-ſide. Then again
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106408:35"/> having Sworn in <hi>Braddons</hi> Examination, That ſhe ſaw the <hi>Razor</hi> thrown out of the Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings, ſhe deny'd in Court upon her Oath, that ſhe knew where his Lodgings were.

And all this done in open Day when there were abundance of People there, though ſhe could not tell any particular Body. Upon which the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> made this Remark, That it was ſtrange, that out of a hundred People, which if the Girl ſaid true, were there, <hi>Braddon</hi> could not ſatisfie himſelf to enquire after ſome of them, but muſt pick up a Child of thirteen Years of Age, to practice upon in that villainous manner.</p>
            <p>Moreover, by the Accompt which <hi>C.

            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Glasbrook</hi> being call'd, who had ſet his Hand to <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Examination or Information, it was prov'd upon reading <note place="margin">Will.

            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Smith</hi> a <hi>Barber</hi> being call'd, ſpoke much to the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> ſo clearly diſplay'd the Contradictions of the <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> and the Improbability of the <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> and ſo plainly trac'd them through all their <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurities</hi> and <hi>Ambiguities,</hi> that the <hi>Jury</hi> found <hi>Braddon</hi> guilty of the whole <hi>Matter</hi> Charg'd upon him in the <hi>Information,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Speak</hi> guilty of all, but Conſpiring to procure falſe <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon the Court ſet a Fine of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Braddon,</hi> with Order to find <hi>Sureties</hi> for his good <hi>Behaviour</hi> during Life, and to be committed till the ſame be performed.</p>

               <hi>Majeſty</hi> who ſubſcrib'd them? he Anſwered, They were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by one of his Servants, and ſo order'd to be ſent to the <hi>Poſt-Houſe.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Oſland</hi> being call'd and Sworn, depoſed, That he wrote one of the <hi>Letters</hi> out of a Copy, given him by Sir <hi>Samuel,</hi> as he <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Oſland.</hi>
               </note> was his Servant, to go down into the <hi>Country</hi> to Sir <hi>Phillip Skippon.</hi>

            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of Counſel for the <hi>Defendant</hi> pleaded, That there was no proof of Sir <hi>Samuels</hi> publiſhing the <hi>Letters,</hi> only what Mr. <hi>Brathwayt</hi> ſaid, That he did not deny the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and what Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> ſaid, That Sir <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould ſay they were ſent to the <hi>Poſt-Houſe.</hi> Upon which Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> put it to the Court, Whether if a Gentleman writes a <hi>Letter</hi> to a private <hi>Friend,</hi> that was a publiſhing of a <hi>Libel?</hi> neither was

            <p>Then it was urg'd that there was no <hi>Evidence</hi> given about his <hi>Malice.</hi> To which the <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> reply'd, That the thing was <hi>Evidence</hi> of it ſelf; For that if any perſon wrote <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> or publiſhed any <hi>Expreſſions</hi> which in themſelves, carryed <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> and <hi>ill will</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> they could not be otherwiſe expreſſed in his <hi>Accuſation,</hi> then by the words <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly, Seditiouſly,</hi> and <hi>Factiouſly;</hi> and the very proof of the thing it ſelf, prov'd the Evil Mind wherewith it was done.</p>
            <p>Then as to the firſt <hi>Objection</hi> about the writing and publiſhing, it was delivered as the Judgment of the <hi>Court,</hi> that there was as full and plain proof of the dictating and writing of the <hi>Letters,</hi> as could be made.</p>
            <p>Then as to what Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> objected againſt the publiſhing it, was ask'd him, whether it were not very abſur'd, to think that ſuch a perſon as Sir <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſhould take ſuch a wonderful deal of pains and care to write ſuch a deal of <hi>Malicious Factious Stuff,</hi> give them his Man to Copy out, ſubſcribe and ſeal them to carry in his Pocket.

               <hi>The Narrative, Arraignment, Condemnation, Confeſſion and Execution of</hi> James Holloway.</head>
            <p>UPON the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>April, 1684. James Holloway</hi> was brought by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> from <hi>Newgate,</hi> there to ſhew cauſe why <hi>Execution</hi> ſhould not be awarded againſt him, upon an <hi>Outlawry</hi> for <hi>High Treaſon</hi> againſt him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>James Holloway</hi> being deeply concerned in the <hi>Plot,</hi> upon the firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery had made a ſhift to make his Eſcape in a ſmall Veſſel which he hir'd for 20 <hi>l. per. Month,</hi> from <hi>Briſtol</hi> to <hi>Rochel;</hi> where having loaden his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with <hi>Brandy</hi> and other Goods, he Sail'd away for <hi>Barbado's:</hi> but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there that his Name was in the <hi>Gazett,</hi> he haſtned to <hi>Antego;</hi> but neither thinking it ſafe to lye long there, he reſolv'd to viſit the <hi>Charibdee Iſlands,</hi> and ſo went down to <hi>Montferrat, Mevis,</hi> St. <hi>Chriſtophers, Sancta-Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and <hi>Anguilla,</hi> and ſo back again to St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> which he ſuppoſed to be the ſafeſt place, as being unknown to any there. Where after he had ſtay'd three Weeks, he wrote to his <hi>Factor</hi> in <hi>Mevis,</hi> to even his Accompts,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106408:37"/> who upon receipt of his Letter Diſcover'd him. So that Sir <hi>William Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> preſently ſent his Warrant to St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> to Apprehend him; but being remov'd from thence to <hi>Eſtatia,</hi> he was purſued thither, and there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Deputy Governour</hi> of St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> to whom he ſubmitted, from thence he was ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and ſo committed to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he was there he wrote a Paper, which he call'd, <hi>His free Confeſſion and Narrative,</hi> Addreſſed to His Majeſty, and delivered by himſelf to Mr. <hi>Secretary Jenkins.</hi> But there does not appear to be any thing more in it, then what has been opened and diſcovered at the <hi>Tryals</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors</hi> Executed before him; unleſs it were what was to have been Acted in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which was to have been ſecur'd by ſurprize, with about 350 Men, of which 200 were to be rais'd in and about the <hi>City,</hi> and the reſt to have been ſent from <hi>Taunton;</hi> toward the concluſion of which <hi>Narrative,</hi> he tells the World, That he had given to his Majeſty the Names of ſeveral other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, beſides thoſe already known, who were to have been concerned in the Plot: which is all wherein he materially differs from the reſt of the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers:</p>
            <p>Being therefore brought to the Bar, and demanded what he had to ſay, why <hi>Execution</hi> ſhould not be awarded againſt him, upon the attainder of <hi>Outlawry</hi> for <hi>Treaſon?</hi> he Anſwered, That he had made an Ingenius Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to His Majeſty, and begg'd his Mercy.</p>
            <p>Then the Court told him, That notwithſtanding the <hi>Outlawry</hi> againſt him, if he had a mind to try the Fact, and thought he could defend himſelf, he ſhould have the Liberty.</p>
            <p>To which the Priſoner Anſwered, That he could not undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, for that he had Confeſſed before His Majeſty, that he was guilty of many things in the Indictment.</p>
            <p>When he came to the place of <hi>Execution,</hi> he Confeſſed his Belief of a Plot, and that he was concern'd in it; but notwithſtanding his Contrition, he could not chuſe but accuſe the Government of managing ſeveral things ill, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, and the Kingdoms Intereſt: and then by way of Direction, he thought it His Majeſties beſt way to call a Parliament, and paſs an <hi>Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion</hi> for all the <hi>Plotters</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and then by way Admonition, he wiſh'd the King would Conſult his own ſafety, and the ſafety of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and that there might be an end put to all <hi>News-mongers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He deteſted the Deſign upon the King at the <hi>Rye,</hi> but own'd to be in a Plot for ſeizing the King, as being inform'd, That if the King could but once have been acquainted with thoſe things that were done contrary to his knowledge, he would have come over to them that ſtood for his aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Being urg'd to give the Names of ſuch perſons as he had ſpoken of? he Anſwered, It would be a Folly in him to abuſe Men that he knew not whether they would be concerned or no, though he believ'd, that if he ſhould Name all that he thought would have been concerned in his Deſign, he might Name three parts of <hi>London.</hi> His laſt wheedle was, That he had no Deſign againſt His Majeſties Perſon, but that what was intended, was only for the good of the King and Kingdom, and that ſo he ſuppos'd it would have been.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Paper</hi> Delivered to the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> was but an <hi>Epitemy</hi> of his <hi>Confeſſion</hi> to the King; which has been already ſaid, was no more then an Accompt of what has been already <hi>Printed</hi> in all the conſiderable <hi>Tryals</hi> of the late <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Offenders,</hi> or rather not ſo much.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, As for his <hi>Religion,</hi> he profeſſed himſelf neither a <hi>Diſſenter</hi> from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> nor joyn'd with them altogether: concluding his laſt Words, That the <hi>Scriblers</hi> might be put down, as having done the Kingdom more Miſchief then any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>After which being ask'd whether he had any more to ſay? he Anſwered, No; and then the <hi>Sheriff</hi> deſired of God to have Mercy on his Soul.</p>

            <head>AN ABSTRACT OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> AT VVESTMINSTER AGAINST S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Armſtrong, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon an Outlawry for High-Treaſon, upon</hi> Saturday <hi>June, the 14h.</hi> 1684.</head>
            <byline>BY <hi>ANOTHER HAND.</hi>

            <p>SIR <hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> being then brought to the Bar of the ſaid Court by Vertue of a Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> directed to the Keeper of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and the return of the Writ being read by the Clerk of the Crown, it appeared he was in Cuſtody of the ſaid Keeper, by a Warrant from the Honourable <hi>Sidney Godolphin,</hi> Eſq; one of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Principal Secretaries of State. Which Warrant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read in Court, and the Award of Execution upon the Outlawry being demanded by His Majeſties Attorney General, and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> being thereupon Arraigned, and asked what he had to ſay for himſelf, why Execution ſhould not be awarded againſt him according to Law? At firſt he ſeem'd as having nothing to ſay for himſelf,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106408:38"/> only begg'd a Tryal; which being denyed him as a thing, which indeed it was not in the Power of the Judges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to grant, he then inſiſted upon a Statute made in the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> by which it was provided, That if the Perſon Outlawed, ſhould within one Year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Outlawry was pronounced, or Judgment given thereupon, yield himſelf to the Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> for the time being, and after to Traverſe the Indictment, or Appeal, whereupon the ſaid Outlawry was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that then he ſhould be received to the Traverſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> pretended to render himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Year, being then preſent at the Kings-Bench-Bar, yet the Court did not think this a yielding in the Senſe of the Statute, being at that time under reſtraint, and not at his own diſpoſal, without any ſemblance that he would otherwiſe have yielded up himſelf to Juſtice at all. And indeed it is very ſtrange, that yielding, and being at Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy whether a Man will or no, ſhould be Interpreted the ſame, as if a voluntary act, and a neceſſary misfortune, in which we are only paſſive, were the ſame: beſides that, he that yields only in this Senſe and Circumſtance, when it is impoſſible for him to flye any longer, is in reaſon ſtill looked upon as a flying Perſon, becauſe his Will ſtill flyes though his Body cannot; and he that in all appearance would ſtill continue to flye if he were able, there being before his Apprehenſion, no Antecedent appearance of a voluntary ſurrender, is by no means within the Favour of the Traverſe, becauſe the Reaſon of the Award is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a ſuppoſed acknowledgment of Guilt, which is expreſſ'd by flight, and this tacite Acknowledgment does ſtill remain, if the Perſon do no otherwiſe ſurrender himſelf but by force, and becauſe it vvas not in his Povv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to have avoided it, though he vvould never ſo fain. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Affair may be Illuſtrated by a parallel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; Suppoſe a <hi>French</hi> Army, ſet down before one of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tovvns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the General ſends a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and offers ſuch or ſuch Conditions in Caſe of a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render before ſuch a day, vvhich Conditions are rejected by the Governour of the Town, who ſtands wholly upon his Defence, and vvill hear of no ſort of Overtures vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: It ſo happens upon this, that the Tovvn is taken by Storm before that day comes, the Queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106408:38"/> Burgeſs of this Tovvn may lay claim to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſaid Conditions? And my Opinion is, That a Tovvn taken may be as properly ſaid to yield, as Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong.</hi> Beſides, that is very ſtrange, that an Act of Parliament, vvhich is in other Caſes ſo Nice and Circumſpect, ſometimes by heaping up Synonimous Words, and all other Words of a different ſignification, the better to prevent all exception, ſhould in this be ſo careleſs, as to Confound Liberty and Neceſſity together, the tvvo things of all the World that are the moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from, and Oppoſite to one another.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> after this laid vvhat hold he could on the Favour ſhevvn to <hi>Holloway</hi> a little before, but that being meerly an Act of Grace from the King, vvho is the beſt Judge, and the only Proprietor of his own Favours; and ſo not lying before the Court, after ſome Altercation, Execution was ordered upon the <hi>Fryday</hi> following; and for his Behaviour at the place of Execution, I refer you to the Sheriffs Papers.</p>
